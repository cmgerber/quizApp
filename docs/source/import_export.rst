Importing and exporting data
############################

The primary way of importing and exporting data is through the `/manage_data`
page. There are two operations you can do on this page: importing and
exporting.

=========
Exporting
=========

To export a dump of all data in the database, click on the `Export` link.
Alternatively, you can visit the `/export_data` page. This will take some time
due to the amount of database queries and processing, but it will give you all
the data in the database in spreadsheet form. The tab names correspond to the
types of objects in the database, and the column headers are in the format
`<table_name>_<database_column_name>`. Each row in every tab represents one
database record.

=========
Importing
=========

To import data into the database, you must first fill out a spreadsheet in a
particular way. First click on the "Download Template" link. This template
represents the type of spreadsheet that the import interface is expecting. On
the first tab is some brief documentation. The other tabs are ordered from
parent to child, such that children specify their parents. The general idea is
such:

* Only fill out what you need to for your purposes.
* Do not modify the first row (column headers) of any sheet
* All information that you add must be added under the headers
* Some fields are relations, and some relations link to multiple objects (these are called one to many or many to many).

  * For one to one relations, enter the `id` of the object you want to link to. For
    example, if you want to associate a ParticipantExperiment with a specific
    Experiment, in the `participant_experiment_experiment` column you should
    have the value of the `experiment_id` column of the Experiment you want to
    link to.
  * For one to many or many to many relations, you should have a comma
    separated list of IDs. You can find the IDs the same way you did for one to
    one relations.

You may be asking where you find the IDs for your associations. There are two
possibilities here. 

1. You want to relate an object you are importing with another object you are
   importing (e.g. you are creating an Experiment in your import sheet and want
   to associate a ParticipantExperiment you are creating with it).

   In this case, you must assign the Experiment some id in the `experiment_id`
   column. The value of this ID is not strictly important, as long as it is
   unique in this spreadsheet. Then, in the `participant_experiment_experiment`
   column, enter the ID of the experiment you want to associate with.

2. You want to relate an object you are importing with an object already in the
   database (e.g. you are creating a ParticipantExperiment and you want to add
   it to an existing Experiment).

   In this case, you must look up the ID of the experiment in the export sheet.
   Then, you may put that id in the `participant_experiment_experiment` column
   in your import sheet. Note that you do not need to create a row for this
   experiment in the `Experiment` tab of the import sheet because this
   experiment already exists.

Under the hood, what happens is that every row in the import sheet is added to
both the database and an in-memory mapping that associates the ID that the
object has in the import sheet with the object itself. Let's say the first
object is an Experiment. Then let's say a ParticipantExperiment references an
Experiment by ID. QuizApp will first check the in-memory mapping to see if any
Experiments have the ID that the ParticipantExperiment is referencing. If there
is such an object, then the ParticipantExperiment and Experiment will be
associated. If there isn't, then the database will be queried to see if there
is an Experiment with such an ID.

For a general overview of how the models work, refer to
:ref:`understanding_models`. For a detailed documentation of the models and
their fields (which correspond to the columns in the spreadsheet), refer to
:py:mod:`quizApp.models`.
