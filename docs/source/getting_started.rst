Getting started with QuizApp
############################

**********
Quickstart
**********

Cloning the repository
======================

The first step is to clone the repository onto your disk. ::

    git clone --branch=master git@github.com:PlasmaSheep/quizApp.git

This will check out the most recent stable version of QuizApp. If you like to
live dangerously and want the bleeding edge version, replace ``master`` with
``develop``.

Installing python dependencies
==============================

Next you have to install the python dependencies.

It is best practice to install these dependencies using a virtual environment.
This means that the packages that QuizApp installs are independent from any
packages you already have installed, which reduces any possible compatibility
nightmares.

Before continuing, you should follow the installation instructions for
`virtualenvwrapper`_.

.. _virtualenvwrapper: https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

Now that you've done that, create a virtual environment for QuizApp. ::

    mkvirtualenv quizApp

Now, in the QuizApp directory, run::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all requirements necessary for QuizApp to run.

Setting up the database
=======================

Lastly, you need to set up the database. QuizApp uses MariaDB. If you use MySQL
instead of MariaDB, QuizApp should still work normally. If you have neither,
you should `install MariaDB`_.

.. _install MariaDB: https://downloads.mariadb.org/

Once you have MariaDB installed and running, you need to set up the database::

    ./manage.py create-db

You will be prompted for your MySQL root password. This will create a database
called ``quizapp`` and a user named ``quizapp``.  The default password is
``foobar``, so you are going to want to change it in ``setup_db.sql`` if you
are using QuizApp in production. Otherwise your information will not be secure.

..note::

    ``manage.py`` can handle creation and population of multiple database
    configurations. If you are running a development sever, the above command
    is sufficient. This is because ``manage.py`` defaults to the ``development``
    configuration.

    If you want to set up a production server, you must specify the ``--config``
    option:

        ./mange.py --config production create-db

    Keep this in mind when you see other commands using ``manage.py``.


Running QuizApp
===============

This is essentally all you have to do to install QuizApp. To run QuizApp using
the default Flask webserver, simply run::

    ./manage.py run

However, it is not recommended to use this server for production environments.
See :ref:`production_servers` for instructions on running QuizApp in a
production environment.

*************
Configuration
*************

If you are running quizApp in a production environment, you are definitely
going to want to modify the password of the QuizApp user for extra security.
You are maybe going to want to modify the database name or username that
QuizApp uses.

In any case, there are a variety of methods to change how the database is set
up. One method is to modify ``setup_db.sql`` to contain the username/database
name/password that you would like to use. Then, running ``setup_db.sql`` again
will set up the database according to your new preferences.

However, once your database is configured properly, you must configure QuizApp
to access the database correctly. You can do this using `instance
configuration`_.

.. _instance configuration: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/config/#instance-folders

In QuizApp, the instance folder is called ``instance``. There is a file there
called ``instance_config.py.ex``. If you wish to override any of the default
database settings, you should copy this file to
``instance/instance_config.py``.

In that file, there are two primary options. The first option is the database
URI. The full reference for the URI syntax is located `here`_.

.. _here: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/config/#instance-folders

The other is the secret key. This is used for various cryptographic purposes
and needs to be randomly generated. Refer to the `flask documentation`_ for
instructions on generating secret keys.

.. _flask documentation: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/quickstart/#sessions

In addition, if you plan to use QuizApp with Amazon Mechanical Turk, you will
need to move ``instance/mturk.yaml.ex`` to ``instance/mturk.yaml`` and update
the AWS access key ID and secret key for your mechanical turk user.

.. _production_servers:

******************
Production servers
******************

There are many ways to run QuizApp in a server. However, QuizApp is merely a
platform and does not include a web server.

One popular way to run a server is via gunicorn and nginx. Here is a good
`tutorial`_ for setting up that configuration.

.. _tutorial: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-gunicorn-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-14-041

QuizApp already includes a wsgi file for use with gunicorn, located at
``wsgi.py``.
